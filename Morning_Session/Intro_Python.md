## What is Python?
* Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
  that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It includes data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many more features 
  that make it as useful for complex application development
## Why python became popular?
* Python is used in a variety of purposes, ranging from web development to data science to DevOps. Data science and machine learning becoming more 
  common in many types of companies, and Python becoming a common choice for that purpose.
* This is particularly visible in the growth of the pandas package, which is the fastest-growing Python-related tag on the site. As for which 
  industries are using Python, we found that it is more visited in a few industries, such as electronics, manufacturing, software, government, and especially universities.
## Literate Programming
* Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language,
  such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.
### Platforms to run Python 
* IDLE, PyCharm, PyScripter, PyDev, Anaconda, Jupyter etcâ€¦
### Anaconda
 * Anaconda is a platform/navigator to run python.
### Why should we use Anaconda for Python?
* Anaconda is popular because it brings many of the tools used in data science and machine learning. 
  Anaconda contains,popular python libraries that can be used in data science . It also comes with the jupyter notebook and Ipython distribution. 
  So, it saves you from importing numerous libraries separately
